# Speech recognition for Freesound Audio Tagging 2019

## Introduction

Basic speech recognition implementation using PyTorch. The purposes of this project are: 

  1) Gain familiarity on the intersection of speech-based tasks and DL.
  2) Test the [Verta](https://verta.ai/)'s product on a collaborative environment. 
  
## TODO's:

- [X] Environment set-up.
- [X] Fetch data.
- [ ] Audio preprocessing.
  - [ ] Spectrogram.
  - [ ] Mel Cepstrum Coefficients.
- [ ] Dataset/Dataloader.
- [ ] Architecture.
- [ ] Training.
- [ ] Evaluation.


## Resources

Currently, I have no background in signal processing. I will base most of this projects in:

* [A series of videos by Seth Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7YM-HAz-IY&list=PLhA3b2k8R3t2Ng1WW_7MiXeh1pfQJQi_P&index=1).
